A personal blog app intended for (mostly) just a few users (admins-only).
All site visitors are guests. No user sign-up/log-in options.

 -master branch is for development which includes links to static & media files on their respective folders
 
 -production branch (to follow) will have those links replaced by CDN links. (tried google drive links for images/videos and they're working fine. Uploads  for blog posts are not configured yet. Will have to figure that out first.)
